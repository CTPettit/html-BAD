    <h3>Mission Statement</h3>
    <p>
        If I needed to pinpoint the most significant hurdle anyone who suffers from a 
        mental illness need deal with, it is isolation.  
        Physical diseases like cancer or heart disease are not typically met with the same level of 
        resistance or confusion as a mental illness due to the taboos associated with them.
        Moreover, there is a, I find, lack of real-world comprehensive information for the sufferer to absorb,
        apart from the static and often theoritical skills provided by many professionals and literature. 
        These two points are the keys to this website, and it is my intention to address both. 
        By providing people of any level of illness or deepest addiction with skills and knowledge,
        I hope to add insight into a world that can thus be better navigated and traversed. 
        In essence, I hope to lift the veil and help provide real world recovery to any person
        who suffers from such problems.  Together, I hope we can triumph.
