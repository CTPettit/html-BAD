    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        My name is CT Pettit, and I am the creator of this website.  
        I have been diagnosed with a mental illness 
        (which has changed over the years but always in the same vein) since 2005.  
        After my diagnosis, I made virtually every bad decision one could make during the five years
        that followed; a time I refer to as the Dark Days.  
        However, I sobered up off sereve alcoholism in 2010 and devoted my life to recovery.  
        And while I still have numerous restrictions and limitations from my condition, 
        I am considered high functioning and able to live on my own despite a rather 
        extreme condition that I must still deal with.  I hope to bring the knowledge Iâ€™ve
        acquired over those long years to the table and use it for positive change.
